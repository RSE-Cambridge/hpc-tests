GROMACS:      gmx mdrun, version 2016.6
Executable:   /mnt/nfs/centos/spack/opt/spack/linux-centos8-cascadelake/gcc-9.1.0/gromacs-2016.6-rvnthv3stez7j5k6xdaylm6brpe4qprc/bin/gmx_mpi
Data prefix:  /mnt/nfs/centos/spack/opt/spack/linux-centos8-cascadelake/gcc-9.1.0/gromacs-2016.6-rvnthv3stez7j5k6xdaylm6brpe4qprc

Command line:
  gmx_mpi mdrun -s benchmark.tpr -g 1400k-atoms.log -noconfout


Running on 1 node with total 56 cores, 56 logical cores
Hardware detected on host cpu-h21a8-u25-svn2.cloud.um6p.ma (the node of MPI rank 0):
  CPU info:
    Vendor: Intel
    Brand:  Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8276 CPU @ 2.20GHz
    SIMD instructions most likely to fit this hardware: AVX_512
    SIMD instructions selected at GROMACS compile time: AVX_512

  Hardware topology: Full, with devices

Reading file benchmark.tpr, VERSION 5.1.4 (single precision)
Note: file tpx version 103, software tpx version 110
Changing nstlist from 10 to 25, rlist from 1.2 to 1.23


Will use 40 particle-particle and 16 PME only ranks
This is a guess, check the performance at the end of the log file
Using 56 MPI processes
Using 1 OpenMP thread per MPI process

starting mdrun 'Her1-Her1'
10000 steps,     20.0 ps.

step 75 Turning on dynamic load balancing, because the performance loss due to load imbalance is 22.3 %.


 Average load imbalance: 0.9 %
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 0.8 %
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: Y 0 % Z 0 %
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.623
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 9.4 %

NOTE: 9.4 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had less work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to decrease the number of PME ranks
      or decrease the cut-off and the grid spacing.
