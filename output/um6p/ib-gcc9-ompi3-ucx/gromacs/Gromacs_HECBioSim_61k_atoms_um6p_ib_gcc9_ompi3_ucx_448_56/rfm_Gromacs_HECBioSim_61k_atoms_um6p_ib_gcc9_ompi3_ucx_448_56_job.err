GROMACS:      gmx mdrun, version 2016.6

Data prefix:  /mnt/nfs/centos/spack/opt/spack/linux-centos8-cascadelake/gcc-9.1.0/gromacs-2016.6-rvnthv3stez7j5k6xdaylm6brpe4qprc

Command line:
  gmx_mpi mdrun -s benchmark.tpr -g 61k-atoms.log -noconfout


Running on 8 nodes with total 448 cores, 448 logical cores
  Cores per node:           56
  Logical cores per node:   56
Hardware detected on host cpu-h21a8-u1-svn2.cloud.um6p.ma (the node of MPI rank 0):
  CPU info:
    Vendor: Intel
    Brand:  Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8276 CPU @ 2.20GHz
    SIMD instructions most likely to fit this hardware: AVX_512
    SIMD instructions selected at GROMACS compile time: AVX_512

  Hardware topology: Full, with devices

Reading file benchmark.tpr, VERSION 5.1.4 (single precision)
Note: file tpx version 103, software tpx version 110
Changing nstlist from 10 to 25, rlist from 1.2 to 1.241


Will use 336 particle-particle and 112 PME only ranks
This is a guess, check the performance at the end of the log file
Using 448 MPI processes
Using 1 OpenMP thread per MPI process

starting mdrun 'Protein'
50000 steps,    100.0 ps.

step 7500 Turning on dynamic load balancing, because the performance loss due to load imbalance is 2.1 %.


 Average load imbalance: 11.4 %
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 5.8 %
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 % Y 3 % Z 3 %
 Average PME mesh/force load: 1.184
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 9.0 %

NOTE: 5.8 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.

NOTE: 9.0 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had more work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to increase the number of PME ranks
      or increase the cut-off and the grid spacing.
