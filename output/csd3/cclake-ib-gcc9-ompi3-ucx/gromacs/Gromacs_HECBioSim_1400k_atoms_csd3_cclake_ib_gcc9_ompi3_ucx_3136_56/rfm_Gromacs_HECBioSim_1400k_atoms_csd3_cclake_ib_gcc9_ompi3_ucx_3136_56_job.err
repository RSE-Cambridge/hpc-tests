GROMACS:      gmx mdrun, version 2016.6
Executable:   /home/hpcbras1/spack/opt/spack/linux-scientific7-skylake_avx512/gcc-9.1.0/gromacs-2016.6-kgomb677so5w42qytvzkbdmclmzk5mvl/bin/gmx_mpi
Data prefix:  /home/hpcbras1/spack/opt/spack/linux-scientific7-skylake_avx512/gcc-9.1.0/gromacs-2016.6-kgomb677so5w42qytvzkbdmclmzk5mvl
Working dir:  /home/hpcbras1/hpc-tests/stage/csd3/cclake-ib-gcc9-ompi3-ucx/gromacs/Gromacs_HECBioSim_1400k_atoms_csd3_cclake_ib_gcc9_ompi3_ucx_3136_56
Command line:
  gmx_mpi mdrun -s benchmark.tpr -g 1400k-atoms.log -noconfout


Running on 56 nodes with total 56 cores, 56 logical cores
  Cores per node:            1 - 56
  Logical cores per node:    1 - 56
Hardware detected on host cpu-p-169 (the node of MPI rank 0):
  CPU info:
    Vendor: Intel
    Brand:  Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8276 CPU @ 2.20GHz
    SIMD instructions most likely to fit this hardware: AVX_512
    SIMD instructions selected at GROMACS compile time: AVX_512

  Hardware topology: Full, with devices

Reading file benchmark.tpr, VERSION 5.1.4 (single precision)
Note: file tpx version 103, software tpx version 110
Changing nstlist from 10 to 25, rlist from 1.2 to 1.23

The number of OpenMP threads was set by environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS to 1

Will use 2352 particle-particle and 784 PME only ranks
This is a guess, check the performance at the end of the log file
Using 3136 MPI processes
Using 1 OpenMP thread per MPI process


Non-default thread affinity set probably by the OpenMP library,
disabling internal thread affinity
starting mdrun 'Her1-Her1'
10000 steps,     20.0 ps.

step 5000 Turning on dynamic load balancing, because the performance loss due to load imbalance is 3.7 %.


 Average load imbalance: 15.3 %
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 6.7 %
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 % Y 0 % Z 3 %
 Average PME mesh/force load: 1.234
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 10.3 %

NOTE: 6.7 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.

NOTE: 10.3 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had more work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to increase the number of PME ranks
      or increase the cut-off and the grid spacing.


               Core t (s)   Wall t (s)        (%)
       Time:   114424.812       36.488   313600.0

Performance:       47.363        0.507

GROMACS reminds you: "On average, it takes twenty years for the world's largest super computer to shrink down to the size of your laptop." (Pete Beckman)
