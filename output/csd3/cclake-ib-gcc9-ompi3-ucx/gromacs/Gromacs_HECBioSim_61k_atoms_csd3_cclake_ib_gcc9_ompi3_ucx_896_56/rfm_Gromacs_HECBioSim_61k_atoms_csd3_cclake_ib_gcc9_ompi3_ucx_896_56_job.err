Command line:
  gmx_mpi mdrun -s benchmark.tpr -g 61k-atoms.log -noconfout


Running on 16 nodes with total 16 cores, 16 logical cores
  Cores per node:            1 - 56
  Logical cores per node:    1 - 56
Hardware detected on host cpu-p-296 (the node of MPI rank 0):
  CPU info:
    Vendor: Intel
    Brand:  Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8276 CPU @ 2.20GHz
    SIMD instructions most likely to fit this hardware: AVX_512
    SIMD instructions selected at GROMACS compile time: AVX_512

  Hardware topology: Full, with devices

Reading file benchmark.tpr, VERSION 5.1.4 (single precision)
Note: file tpx version 103, software tpx version 110
Changing nstlist from 10 to 25, rlist from 1.2 to 1.241

The number of OpenMP threads was set by environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS to 1

Will use 672 particle-particle and 224 PME only ranks
This is a guess, check the performance at the end of the log file
Using 896 MPI processes
Using 1 OpenMP thread per MPI process


Non-default thread affinity set probably by the OpenMP library,
disabling internal thread affinity
starting mdrun 'Protein'
50000 steps,    100.0 ps.

 Average load imbalance: 85.8 %
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 4.9 %
 Average PME mesh/force load: 1.314
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 2.9 %
