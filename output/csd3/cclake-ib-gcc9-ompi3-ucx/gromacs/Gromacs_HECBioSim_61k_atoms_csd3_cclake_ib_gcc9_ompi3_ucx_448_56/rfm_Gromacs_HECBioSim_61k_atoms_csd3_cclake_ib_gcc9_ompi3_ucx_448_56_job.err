GROMACS:      gmx mdrun, version 2016.6
Executable:   /home/hpcbras1/spack/opt/spack/linux-scientific7-skylake_avx512/gcc-9.1.0/gromacs-2016.6-kgomb677so5w42qytvzkbdmclmzk5mvl/bin/gmx_mpi
Data prefix:  /home/hpcbras1/spack/opt/spack/linux-scientific7-skylake_avx512/gcc-9.1.0/gromacs-2016.6-kgomb677so5w42qytvzkbdmclmzk5mvl
Working dir:  /home/hpcbras1/hpc-tests/stage/csd3/cclake-ib-gcc9-ompi3-ucx/gromacs/Gromacs_HECBioSim_61k_atoms_csd3_cclake_ib_gcc9_ompi3_ucx_448_56
Command line:
  gmx_mpi mdrun -s benchmark.tpr -g 61k-atoms.log -noconfout


Running on 8 nodes with total 8 cores, 8 logical cores
  Cores per node:            1 - 56
  Logical cores per node:    1 - 56
Hardware detected on host cpu-p-176 (the node of MPI rank 0):
  CPU info:
    Vendor: Intel
    Brand:  Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8276 CPU @ 2.20GHz
    SIMD instructions most likely to fit this hardware: AVX_512
    SIMD instructions selected at GROMACS compile time: AVX_512

  Hardware topology: Full, with devices

Reading file benchmark.tpr, VERSION 5.1.4 (single precision)
Note: file tpx version 103, software tpx version 110
Changing nstlist from 10 to 25, rlist from 1.2 to 1.241

The number of OpenMP threads was set by environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS to 1

Will use 336 particle-particle and 112 PME only ranks
This is a guess, check the performance at the end of the log file
Using 448 MPI processes
Using 1 OpenMP thread per MPI process


Non-default thread affinity set probably by the OpenMP library,
disabling internal thread affinity
starting mdrun 'Protein'
50000 steps,    100.0 ps.

step 7500 Turning on dynamic load balancing, because the performance loss due to load imbalance is 2.2 %.


 Average load imbalance: 10.9 %
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 5.4 %
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 % Y 2 % Z 3 %
 Average PME mesh/force load: 1.171
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 8.4 %

NOTE: 5.4 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.

NOTE: 8.4 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had more work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to increase the number of PME ranks
      or increase the cut-off and the grid spacing.

       Time:    14131.319       31.543    44800.0
                 (ns/day)    (hour/ns)
Performance:      273.916        0.088
