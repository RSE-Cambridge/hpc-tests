GROMACS:      gmx mdrun, version 2016.6

Command line:
  gmx_mpi mdrun -s benchmark.tpr -g 61k-atoms.log -noconfout


Running on 2 nodes with total 2 cores, 2 logical cores
  Cores per node:            1 - 56
  Logical cores per node:    1 - 56
Hardware detected on host cpu-p-282 (the node of MPI rank 0):
  CPU info:
    Vendor: Intel
    Brand:  Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8276 CPU @ 2.20GHz
    SIMD instructions most likely to fit this hardware: AVX_512
    SIMD instructions selected at GROMACS compile time: AVX_512

  Hardware topology: Full, with devices

Reading file benchmark.tpr, VERSION 5.1.4 (single precision)
Note: file tpx version 103, software tpx version 110
Changing nstlist from 10 to 25, rlist from 1.2 to 1.241

The number of OpenMP threads was set by environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS to 1

Will use 84 particle-particle and 28 PME only ranks
This is a guess, check the performance at the end of the log file
Using 112 MPI processes
Using 1 OpenMP thread per MPI process


Non-default thread affinity set probably by the OpenMP library,
disabling internal thread affinity
starting mdrun 'Protein'
50000 steps,    100.0 ps.

step 75 Turning on dynamic load balancing, because the performance loss due to load imbalance is 2.4 %.


step 500 Turning off dynamic load balancing, because it is degrading performance.


step 12500 Turning on dynamic load balancing, because the performance loss due to load imbalance is 2.0 %.


step 13000 Turning off dynamic load balancing, because it is degrading performance.


step 15000 Will no longer try dynamic load balancing, as it degraded performance.


 Average load imbalance: 21.4 %
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 3.2 %
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.398
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 12.3 %

NOTE: 12.3 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had less work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to decrease the number of PME ranks
      or decrease the cut-off and the grid spacing.

Performance:       76.926        0.312
