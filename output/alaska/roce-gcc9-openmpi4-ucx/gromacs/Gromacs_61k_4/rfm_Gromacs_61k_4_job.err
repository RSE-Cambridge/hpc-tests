Working dir:  /alaska/steveb/hpc-tests/stage/alaska/roce-gcc9-openmpi4-ucx/gromacs/Gromacs_61k_4
Command line:
  gmx_mpi mdrun -s benchmark.tpr -g 61k-atoms.log -noconfout


Running on 4 nodes with total 128 cores, 256 logical cores
  Cores per node:           32
  Logical cores per node:   64
Hardware detected on host openhpc-compute-2 (the node of MPI rank 0):
  CPU info:
    Vendor: Intel
    Brand:  Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2683 v4 @ 2.10GHz
    SIMD instructions most likely to fit this hardware: AVX2_256
    SIMD instructions selected at GROMACS compile time: AVX2_256

  Hardware topology: Full, with devices

Reading file benchmark.tpr, VERSION 5.1.4 (single precision)
Note: file tpx version 103, software tpx version 110
Changing nstlist from 10 to 20, rlist from 1.2 to 1.224


Will use 96 particle-particle and 32 PME only ranks
This is a guess, check the performance at the end of the log file
Using 128 MPI processes
Using 2 OpenMP threads per MPI process

50000 steps,    100.0 ps.

step 8000 Turning on dynamic load balancing, because the performance loss due to load imbalance is 2.7 %.


step 8400 Turning off dynamic load balancing, because it is degrading performance.


step 14000 Turning on dynamic load balancing, because the performance loss due to load imbalance is 4.7 %.


step 14400 Turning off dynamic load balancing, because it is degrading performance.


step 16000 Turning on dynamic load balancing, because the performance loss due to load imbalance is 5.2 %.


 Average load imbalance: 25.6 %
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 6.6 %
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 % Y 0 % Z 0 %
 Average PME mesh/force load: 1.242
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 10.9 %

NOTE: 6.6 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.

NOTE: 10.9 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had more work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to increase the number of PME ranks
      or increase the cut-off and the grid spacing.
