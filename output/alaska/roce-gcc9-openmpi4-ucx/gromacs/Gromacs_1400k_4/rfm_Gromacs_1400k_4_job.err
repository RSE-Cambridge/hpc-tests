Working dir:  /alaska/steveb/hpc-tests/stage/alaska/roce-gcc9-openmpi4-ucx/gromacs/Gromacs_1400k_4
Command line:
  gmx_mpi mdrun -s benchmark.tpr -g 1400k-atoms.log -noconfout


Running on 4 nodes with total 128 cores, 256 logical cores
  Cores per node:           32
  Logical cores per node:   64
Hardware detected on host openhpc-compute-10 (the node of MPI rank 0):
  CPU info:
    Vendor: Intel
    Brand:  Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2683 v4 @ 2.10GHz
    SIMD instructions most likely to fit this hardware: AVX2_256
    SIMD instructions selected at GROMACS compile time: AVX2_256

  Hardware topology: Full, with devices

Reading file benchmark.tpr, VERSION 5.1.4 (single precision)
Note: file tpx version 103, software tpx version 110
Changing nstlist from 10 to 25, rlist from 1.2 to 1.23


Will use 96 particle-particle and 32 PME only ranks
This is a guess, check the performance at the end of the log file
Using 128 MPI processes
Using 2 OpenMP threads per MPI process

starting mdrun 'Her1-Her1'
10000 steps,     20.0 ps.

step 75 Turning on dynamic load balancing, because the performance loss due to load imbalance is 8.4 %.


step 500 Turning off dynamic load balancing, because it is degrading performance.


step 5000 Turning on dynamic load balancing, because the performance loss due to load imbalance is 2.3 %.


step 5500 Turning off dynamic load balancing, because it is degrading performance.


step 7500 Will no longer try dynamic load balancing, as it degraded performance.


 Average load imbalance: 5.6 %
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 2.6 %
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.995
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 0.1 %
