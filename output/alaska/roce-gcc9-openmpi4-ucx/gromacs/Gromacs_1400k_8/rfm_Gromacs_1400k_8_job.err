GROMACS:      gmx mdrun, version 2016.4
Executable:   /alaska/steveb/spack/opt/spack/linux-centos7-broadwell/gcc-9.3.0/gromacs-2016.4-y5sjbs44dv3c5ky2godzmvtt7doh4e7f/bin/gmx_mpi
Data prefix:  /alaska/steveb/spack/opt/spack/linux-centos7-broadwell/gcc-9.3.0/gromacs-2016.4-y5sjbs44dv3c5ky2godzmvtt7doh4e7f
Working dir:  /alaska/steveb/hpc-tests/stage/alaska/roce-gcc9-openmpi4-ucx/gromacs/Gromacs_1400k_8
Command line:
  gmx_mpi mdrun -s benchmark.tpr -g 1400k-atoms.log -noconfout


Running on 8 nodes with total 256 cores, 512 logical cores
  Cores per node:           32
  Logical cores per node:   64
Hardware detected on host openhpc-compute-6 (the node of MPI rank 0):
  CPU info:
    Vendor: Intel
    Brand:  Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2683 v4 @ 2.10GHz
    SIMD instructions most likely to fit this hardware: AVX2_256
    SIMD instructions selected at GROMACS compile time: AVX2_256

  Hardware topology: Full, with devices

Reading file benchmark.tpr, VERSION 5.1.4 (single precision)
Note: file tpx version 103, software tpx version 110
Changing nstlist from 10 to 25, rlist from 1.2 to 1.23


Will use 192 particle-particle and 64 PME only ranks
This is a guess, check the performance at the end of the log file
Using 256 MPI processes
Using 2 OpenMP threads per MPI process

starting mdrun 'Her1-Her1'
10000 steps,     20.0 ps.

 Average load imbalance: 20.1 %
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 7.9 %
 Average PME mesh/force load: 1.320
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 14.6 %

NOTE: 7.9 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.
      You might want to use dynamic load balancing (option -dlb.)

NOTE: 14.6 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had more work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to increase the number of PME ranks
      or increase the cut-off and the grid spacing.
