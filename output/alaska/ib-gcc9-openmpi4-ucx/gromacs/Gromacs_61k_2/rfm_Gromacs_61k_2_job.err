GROMACS:      gmx mdrun, version 2016.4
Executable:   /alaska/steveb/spack/opt/spack/linux-centos7-broadwell/gcc-9.3.0/gromacs-2016.4-y5sjbs44dv3c5ky2godzmvtt7doh4e7f/bin/gmx_mpi

Working dir:  /alaska/steveb/hpc-tests/stage/alaska/ib-gcc9-openmpi4-ucx/gromacs/Gromacs_61k_2
Command line:
  gmx_mpi mdrun -s benchmark.tpr -g 61k-atoms.log -noconfout


Running on 2 nodes with total 64 cores, 128 logical cores
  Cores per node:           32
  Logical cores per node:   64
Hardware detected on host openhpc-compute-14 (the node of MPI rank 0):
  CPU info:
    Vendor: Intel
    Brand:  Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2683 v4 @ 2.10GHz
    SIMD instructions most likely to fit this hardware: AVX2_256
    SIMD instructions selected at GROMACS compile time: AVX2_256

  Hardware topology: Full, with devices

Reading file benchmark.tpr, VERSION 5.1.4 (single precision)
Note: file tpx version 103, software tpx version 110
Changing nstlist from 10 to 20, rlist from 1.2 to 1.224


Will use 48 particle-particle and 16 PME only ranks
This is a guess, check the performance at the end of the log file
Using 64 MPI processes
Using 2 OpenMP threads per MPI process

starting mdrun 'Protein'
50000 steps,    100.0 ps.

step 2000 Turning on dynamic load balancing, because the performance loss due to load imbalance is 2.4 %.


step 2400 Turning off dynamic load balancing, because it is degrading performance.


step 6000 Turning on dynamic load balancing, because the performance loss due to load imbalance is 3.9 %.


step 6400 Turning off dynamic load balancing, because it is degrading performance.


step 8000 Will no longer try dynamic load balancing, as it degraded performance.


 Average load imbalance: 14.1 %
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 5.6 %
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.668
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 4.8 %

NOTE: 5.6 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.
      You might want to use dynamic load balancing (option -dlb.)
