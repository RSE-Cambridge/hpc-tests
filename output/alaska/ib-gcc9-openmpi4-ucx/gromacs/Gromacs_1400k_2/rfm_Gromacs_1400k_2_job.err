Working dir:  /alaska/steveb/hpc-tests/stage/alaska/ib-gcc9-openmpi4-ucx/gromacs/Gromacs_1400k_2
Command line:
  gmx_mpi mdrun -s benchmark.tpr -g 1400k-atoms.log -noconfout


Running on 2 nodes with total 64 cores, 128 logical cores
  Cores per node:           32
  Logical cores per node:   64
Hardware detected on host openhpc-compute-2 (the node of MPI rank 0):
  CPU info:
    Vendor: Intel
    Brand:  Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2683 v4 @ 2.10GHz
    SIMD instructions most likely to fit this hardware: AVX2_256
    SIMD instructions selected at GROMACS compile time: AVX2_256

  Hardware topology: Full, with devices

Reading file benchmark.tpr, VERSION 5.1.4 (single precision)
Note: file tpx version 103, software tpx version 110
Changing nstlist from 10 to 25, rlist from 1.2 to 1.23


Will use 48 particle-particle and 16 PME only ranks
This is a guess, check the performance at the end of the log file
Using 64 MPI processes
Using 2 OpenMP threads per MPI process

starting mdrun 'Her1-Her1'
10000 steps,     20.0 ps.

step 75 Turning on dynamic load balancing, because the performance loss due to load imbalance is 7.2 %.


step 2000 Turning off dynamic load balancing, because it is degrading performance.


step 10000 Turning on dynamic load balancing, because the performance loss due to load imbalance is 2.1 %.


 Average load imbalance: 2.8 %
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 2.1 %
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: Y 0 % Z 0 %
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.799
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 4.3 %

GROMACS reminds you: "Even the *healthy* people move in clouds of cigarette smoke, women straining polyester, men in raggedly cutoffs slathering mayonnaise on foot-long hot dogs. It's as if the hotel were hosting a conference on adult onset diabetes" (Jess Walter)
